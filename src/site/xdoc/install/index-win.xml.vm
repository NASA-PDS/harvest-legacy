    <section name="Windows System Properties">
      <p>The required environment variables for the <i>${project.artifactId}</i> package can also be set through the Windows system properties panel. The instructions provided below were based off of a Windows 7 machine. Windows 8 and 10 users should be able to use these steps as well to modify their environment.
      </p>
      
      <p>The <i>Path</i> environment variable can be modified as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Click on the Windows icon on the bottom left. In the search text box, type in <i>edit system environment variables</i>. A search result called <i>Edit the system environment variables</i> should appear under the <i>Control Panel</i> area as follows:
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <center><img src="../images/windows_search.jpg"/></center>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Click on <i>Edit the system environment variables</i> and in there, click on the <i>Environment Variables</i> button. At this point, you should now see a window like the one below:
        </li>
      </ul>

      <center><img src="../images/windows_panel.jpg"/></center>

      <ul>
        <li>Highlight the <i>Path</i> variable in the System Variables list and select the <i>Edit</i> button.
        </li>
        <li>Append to the current contents of the variable, the path to the <i>bin</i> directory within <i>${project.artifactId}</i> package. Separate the package path from the current contents of the variable with a semicolon.
        </li>
        <li>Select the <i>OK</i> button when you are finished editing the <i>Path</i> variable, then select the <i>OK</i> button on the Environment Variables window to apply the changes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>New environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME) may also be specified in the system properties panel. Instead of selecting the <i>Edit</i> button from the System Variables list, select the <i>New</i> button and enter the variable name and value. Select the <i>OK</i> button when you are finished, then select the <i>OK</i> button on the Environment Variables window to apply the changes.
      </p>

      <p>Note: If you already have a DOS window open, you will need to close and re-open the window for the environment variable changes to take effect.
