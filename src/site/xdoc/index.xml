    <section name="About Registry">
      <p>The Registry component provides functionality for tracking, searching, auditing, locating, and maintaining artifacts within the system. These artifacts can range from data files and label files, schemas, dictionary definitions for objects and elements, services, etc. The core functionality for this component is satisfied by <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>.
      </p>

      <p>For Build 9b (June 2019), the Registry and Search components of the PDS4 system received a major upgrade and significant re-design to greater leverage the power of Apache Solr. We are continuing to improve our documentation, but please do not hesitate to send questions, comments, change requests and bug reports to the <a href="mailto:pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov">PDS Operator</a> at pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov and we would be happy to help work through any issues you are having.
