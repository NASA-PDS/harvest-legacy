  The High-Speed Occultation Timing Photometer is operated by the             
  University of Maryland (UMD).  The system consists of a portable            
  Celestron C-14 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, a photometry package           
  (optics, selectable apertures, eyepiece, and detector), and                 
  an electronics package for operating the system and recording data.

  For observations with the photomultiplier detector, any one of              
  four apertures is inserted into the focal plane of the telescope,           
  to select a field of view of 30 arcseconds.  The aperture is                
  positioned over the target of interest, and all light passing               
  through is recorded by the photomultiplier tube and electronics             
  as a function of time.                                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
Detector                                                                      
========                                                                      
                                                                              
  The detector is an EMI 9892B/350 bi-alkali, borosilicate                    
  photomultiplier tube with end-on illumination.  For observations            
  made without filters, the responsivity is determined mainly by              
  the combination of the photocathode response with the borosilicate          
  transmission curve:  peak response occurs near 375 nm and                   
  half-quantum-efficiency points occur near 310 nm and 520 nm.                
  The resultant bandpass of the telescope and photometer system               
  ranges from 312 to 615 nanometers with an effective wavelength of           
  453 nanometers.                                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
Electronics                                                                   
===========                                                                   
                                                                              
  The electronics package first converts signal (from the target) and         
  reference currents to voltages, then to audio signals using a               
  voltage-to-frequency converter.  The electronics combine the                
  audio signal with an audio timing broadcast and voice comments,             
  then record these data on a four-track audiotape recorder.                  
                                                                              
  The audio timing track is typically time and frequency information          
  broadcast by the WWV radio station operated by the National Institute       
  of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Information about WWV is available     
  at the NIST Time and Frequency web site:                                    
                                                                              
    http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/index.html                                    
                                                                              
  During data collection, the observers record the UTC time associated        
  with selected WWV seconds ticks.  Later, the four-track audiotapes          
  are digitized, and the recorded UTC times are used to synchronize           
  the data.  The resulting digitized data are considered to be raw.           
                                                                              
  Before the D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact expedition to Mt. Singleton,           
  the UMD high-speed digital electronics were inoperable.  A similar          
  occultation timing system with the same high-speed analog electronics       
  was borrowed from Lowell Observatory and used on this expedition.           
                                                                              
                                                                              
Measured Parameters

  For the D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 expedition to Mt. Singleton, the goal            
  was to measure the light curves of Io and Europa during the impacts         
  of several fragments of the comet with Jupiter.  The following data         
  were recorded directly onto a four-track audiotape:                         
                                                                              
    1. Data counts produced the photometer, recorded as a frequency           
    2. WWV time signals                                                       
    3. A 60Hz reference signal                                                
    4. Voice comments of the observers

  To perform tracking, the target should first be centered in the field       
  of view.  Then, an observer looks through the five-inch finder scope        
  attached to the telescope and uses a hand paddle to guide on the target.    
  Wind may interfere with tracking if the system is unprotected.
