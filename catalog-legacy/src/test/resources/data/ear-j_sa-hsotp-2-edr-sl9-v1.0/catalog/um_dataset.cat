  Io and Europa of the impact fireballs produced as the D, E, K, and N        
  fragments of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit the atmosphere of Jupiter.        
  The data were acquired during the predicted impact period for each          
  fragment, from 17 through 20 July 1994.

    The following paragraphs were paraphrased from Woodney et al. (1998)      
    [WOODNEYETAL1998].                                                        
                                                                              
    At Mt. Singleton in West Australia, the University of Maryland/Perth      
    Observatory team used a high-speed occultation timing photometer and      
    a 14-inch Celestron to look for flashes off Io or Europa during the       
    expected impact times of the D, E, K, N and P2 fragments.  During the     
    D, E, N, and P2 impacts, Io was observed, while Europa was the target     
    for the K impact.  This fragment was predicted to illuminate Europa       
    while the moon was in eclipse with Jupiter, possibly making the           
    satellite temporarily visible from Earth.  The flashes from Io            
    were expected to be small compared to the reflected solar component       
    (one to ten percent), so the best opportunity to observe an effect        
    was during an eclipse.                                                    
                                                                              
    The photometer had a bi-alkali photocathode, and the observations were    
    made with no filter.  The resultant bandpass of the whole system          
    ranged from 312 to 615 nanometers, with an effective wavelength of        
    453 nanometers.  The team obtained continuous light curves of Io at       
    the predicted times of the impacts of fragments D and E.  Mechanical      
    problems during the impacts of K, N and P2 left large gaps in the         
    temporal coverage.  This severely limits the usefulness of these data.    
    In particular, the P2 data were not included in this data set because     
    this coverage was very sparse.  Therefore, only the following impact      
    data are included in this data set:

    A set of calibration observations was recorded around impact D.           
    These data are also included in this data set.                            
                                                                              
    For each observation the appropriate moon or calibration source was       
    centered in a 30-arcsecond aperture.  The observer tracked the moon       
    by looking through a 5-inch finder scope and using a hand paddle          
    to drive the telescope.  This method, combined with the Jovian scattered  
    light, is one of the larger sources of error in the photometer data.      
    Motion of the moon within the aperture caused variations on the order     
    of five percent as more or less scattered light entered the aperture.     
                                                                              
    For each observing run, a voltage-to-frequency converter was used to      
    record the following data onto a four-track audiotape:                    
                                                                              
      1. Data counts from the target, recorded as a frequency                 
      2. WWV time signals (http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/index.html)            
      3. A 60Hz reference signal                                              
      4. Voice comments of the observers                                      
                                                                              
    To optimize the system for detecting small events, the gain for the       
    voltage-to-frequency converter as high as possible, which caused the      
    sunlit satellites to be near the saturation point.  When the converter    
    saturated,  the frequency went to zero, which led to low values for       
    all saturations when the data were digitized.                             
                                                                              
    During data collection, the observers recorded the UTC time associated    
    with selected second ticks from the WWV and the 60Hz reference signal so  
    that data could be synchronized.

    The following paragraphs are paraphrased from Woodney et al. (1998)       
    [WOODNEYETAL1998].                                                        
                                                                              
    During impact D, the team observed a sunlit Io.  The team had hoped to    
    hoped to observe the flash as a percentage increase in the brightness     
    of the moon.  Data acquired near the time of the D impact are the best    
    set obtained by the team.  The sky was photometric, tracking was good,    
    and there were no mechanical failures.  No flashes were large enough      
    to be seen on a strip chart produced at the time of the observation.      
    However, the digitized data were carefully inspected for the several      
    minutes around the time of the first infrared precursor flash reported    
    by the observers at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT).                 
                                                                              
    At 11:54:20 UT, 26 seconds before the infrared precursor flash was        
    observed at the AAT, a small rise is seen in the digitized data.  The     
    signal rises to about 7 percent above the average over three seconds,     
    plateaus for almost two seconds, then quickly drops back.  While this     
    event seems too long to be noise, the team could not conclusively         
    determine if any reflection off Io of the D impact flash was observed.    
                                                                              
  Results from Impact E                                                       
  ---------------------                                                       
                                                                              
    The following paragraphs are paraphrased from Woodney et al. (1998)       
    [WOODNEYETAL1998].                                                        
                                                                              
    During impact E, the team observed a sunlit Io.  Again, observing         
    conditions were good but the photometer data included many saturations    
    which made it difficult to analyze for evidence of flashes.  However,     
    At the IAU meeting in August 1994, N. Raghavan, of the Nehru Planetarium  
    in New Delhi, reported photographing a flash off Io which started at      
    15:14:42 UT and lasted three seconds.  The team reanalyzed the            
    digitized, high-speed photometer data and found saturations from          
    15:14:40 to 15:14:46.  Since the saturations occur at the same time       
    as the suggested flash, it is possible that the flash caused the last     
    few seconds of saturated data.  Assuming the flash was as the saturation  
    level, the team estimated it to be 15 percent of the brightness  of Io.   
                                                                              
    It is important to note that the start and stop times given in the        
    time-sychronized table for impact E are 11 minutes sooner than those      
    reported by Woodney et al. 1998 [WOODNEYETAL1998].  PDS-SBN could not     
    reconcile either set of times with the UTC of the possible, saturated     
    flash from impact E reported above.  The data table for impact E should   
    be used with caution.

  ---------------------                                                       
                                                                              
    The following paragraphs are paraphrased from Woodney et al. (1998)       
    [WOODNEYETAL1998].                                                        
                                                                              
    The team proposed impact K would provide the best chance to observe       
    a flash because the target, Europa, was in eclipse with Jupiter during    
    the event.  There was not reflected sunlight to overwhelm a lower         
    intensity flash.  While data for this event are similar in quality        
    to the data for E, there are many saturations caused by scattered         
    light from Jupiter entering the aperture.   The team was not able to      
    find evidence of a flash in these data.                                   
                                                                              
  Results from Impact N

    During impact N, the team observed a sunlit Io but high winds and         
    equipment failures resulted in sparse, poor quality data.  However,       
    these data could be digitized and are included in this data set.          
                                                                              
                                                                              
Processing                                                                    
==========                                                                    
                                                                              
  For each observing run, the following data were recorded directly           
  onto a four-track audiotape:                                                
                                                                              
    1. Raw data counts from the target as produced the photometer, then       
       recorded as a frequency                                                
    2. WWV time signals, including seconds ticks                              
    3. A 60Hz reference signal                                                
    4. Voice comments of the observers                                        
                                                                              
  The audiotapes were digitized in the fall of 1994 at Lowell Observatory.    
  Each four-track audiotape was digitized, at a rate of approximately 100     
  samples per second.  The outputs from this process are ASCII tables which   
  contain only two columns:                                                   
                                                                              
    1) Column 1 contains time stamps produced by the digitization process.    
       It contains a series of ones and zeros.  Each occurrence of a one      
       represents the beginning of one second of time, corresponding to       
       a specific clock time as recorded on the audiotape.  The WWV time      
       signals were used when available.  For the K fragment, the WWV was     
       not strong enough on the audiotape for the voice track was used.       
       For samples between the seconds ticks, the digitization process        
       output a zero in this column.  There are approximately 99 samples      
       between each second.  For the first record, the digitization process   
       output a value other than zero or one in this column.  For the         
       time-synchronized version of a table (see the explanation below),      
       the process output a number greater than 63000 in this column to       
       mark the start of the time-synchronized samples.                       
                                                                              
    2) Column 2 provides the intensity of the digitized raw data numbers.     
                                                                              
  Tapes were generally digitized twice:  Once with the time reference         
  beginning at an exact UT time (this is the time-synchronized version        
  as noted in the label) and once with the time reference beginning at        
  the start of the data.  By comparing the two, the exact timing of the       
  entire data set can be determined.  If there was not a clear WWV signal     
  for a data set, or exact timing was not important for a set of              
  observations such as calibrations, there may not be a time-synched          
  digitization for that data set.                                             
                                                                              
  The data provided in this data set are raw and have not been processed      
  beyond the digitization procedure described above.  Woodney et al. (1998)   
  [WOODNEYETAL1998] provide a recipe for converting the observed flux         
  increases into flash luminosities.

  The following naming convention is used for the ASCII data tables that      
  contain data from impact D, E, K, or N:                                     
                                                                              
    TABLfns.TAB  where f = D for impact D data

                           N for impact N data                                
                       n = 1 or 2 for the first or second half of             
                           a set of observations                              
                       s = T for the time-synchronized version of             
                           the impact data; if T is not present,              
                           data file is not time-synchronized                 
                                                                              
  Two calibration tables were provided: TABLD1.TAB and TABL2D1.TAB.           
  While these tables contain observations of standard stars, the data         
  provider did not list the targets.  These calibration tables are not        
  time-synchronized.  TABL2D1.TAB is simply a second digitization of          
  TABLD1.TAB that appears to be noise.                                        
                                                                              
  In addition to the impact and calibration tables, three tables of           
  unspecified targets are provided:  TABL1.TAB, TABL11.TAB, and TABL12.TAB.   
  These data were used to test the digitization of the data using             
  different gains.  TABL12.TAB has the correct gain.

  These data were peer-reviewed in 2002.  During the review it was            
  noted these data are unique and should be archived.  Reviewers              
  indicated these completely raw data could be reduced if someone             
  was determined to do so.                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
Data Coverage and Quality                                                     
=========================                                                     
                                                                              
  Data from impacts D and E data cover the times of the impact events and     
  are reliable.  However, mechanical problems during K and N impacts left     
  large gaps in the time coverage that severely limits the usefulness of      
  these data.                                                                 
                                                                              
  For each observation the moon was centered in a thirty-arcsecond            
  aperture.  An observer looking through a five-inch finder scope             
  manually tracked the target by using a hand paddle.  This tracking          
  method, combined with the Jovian scattered light is one of the larger       
  sources of error in the photometer data.  Motion of the moon within         
  the aperture caused variations on the order of 5 percent as more            
  or less scattered light entered the aperture.  The moon was also            
  occasionally lost from the aperture for brief periods.  Additionally        
  there was no protection from the wind for the telescope and this            
  caused some interference with tracking.                                     
                                                                              
  Specifically, the numerous saturations seen in the data for impact E        
  are attributed to wind buffeting the telescope during these observations.   
  The wind made it difficult to keep Io centered in the aperture,             
  resulting in strong contamination by scattered light from Jupiter.          
  Since the detector was working very close to its limit, this additional     
  light was enough to saturate the detector.                                  
                                                                              
  Also, for impact E, the start and stop times given in the time-sychronized  
  table included in this data set are 11 minutes sooner than those reported   
  by Woodney et al. 1998 [WOODNEYETAL1998].  PDS-SBN could not reconcile      
  either set of times with the UTC of the possible, saturated flash from      
  impact E reported by Woodney et al. 1998 [WOODNEYETAL1998].  Therefore,     
  the data table for impact E should be used with caution.                    
                                                                              
  Finally, an unsynchronized and a time-synchronized data table were          
  provided for impacts D, K, and N.  For impact E, only a time-synchronized   
  data table was provided.                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
Limitations                                                                   
===========                                                                   
                                                                              
  One must be careful when interpreting these data.  Most, if not all         
  changes in these light curves may be due to tracking problems.              
                                                                              
  To optimize the system for detecting small events, the gain for the         
  voltage-to-frequency converter was set as high as possible, which           
  caused the sunlit satellites to be near the saturation point.  When the     
  converter saturated, the frequency went to zero, which led to low values    
  for all saturations when the data were digitized.  Therefore, this is an    
  ambiguity between low values due to saturations and low values due to       
  the loss of the satellite from the aperture.  Values that are below         
  the sky level are clearly saturated.  However, some portion of all          
  low spikes that are still above the sky can be attributed to either         
  saturation or loss of a portion of the moon from the aperture.              
                                                                              
  The data provided in this data set are raw.  While Woodney et al. (1998)    
  [WOODNEYETAL1998] provide a recipe for converting the observed flux
